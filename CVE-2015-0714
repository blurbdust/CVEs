> Cisco Finesse Input Validation Flaw Permits Cross-Site Scripting Attacks
>
> ------------------------------------------
>
> [Additional Information]
> The software does not properly filter HTML code from user-supplied input via
> HTTP GET or POST methods before displaying the input. A remote user can cause 
> arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code 
> will originate from the site running the Cisco Finesse software and will run in 
> the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access 
> the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated 
> with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to 
> the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.

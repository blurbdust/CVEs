> IBM Security Identity Manager could allow a privileged local user to perform unauthorized actions due to reuse of another users JSESSIONID.
>
> ------------------------------------------
>
> [Additional Information]
> The TIM application issues two different JSESSIONID cookies for the Self-service console
> (http://<ITIMServer>/itim/self) and the Administrative console (http://<ITIMServer>/itim/console). 
> In case a privileged user logs in to the Administrative console and performs a log out from the Self-
> service console, the JSESSIONID with path "/itim/console" remains immutable in the browser storage and 
> valid on the server-side. A malicious actor who has physical access to the device with the browser could 
> obtain this valid JSESSIONID cookie.
> 
> A logged in regular user cannot access the Administrative console directly using this cookie, as after
> navigation to http://<ITIMServer>/itim/console the JSESSIONID with path "/itim/console" will be renewed 
> and an error message of "You are not authorized to perform any tasks." will be displayed. However, direct
> navigation to the URL http://<ITIMServer>/itim/console/action/task/home makes it possible to access 
> administrative functions.
